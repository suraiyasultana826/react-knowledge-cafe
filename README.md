 Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A componentâ€™s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system-generated events and these changes determine the behavior of the component and how it will render.  In React, the state is data or properties you can use in our application. States are mutable, meaning their value can change, and for that, the useState() hook is used to handle and manage your states. The useState() hook allows you to create, track and update a state in functional components.
